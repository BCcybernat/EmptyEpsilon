Thank you for buying this model pack.


The textures can be used in a PBR environment (metalness workflow) as well as a non 
PBR environment.

-	Albedo map, PNG format
-	Ambient Occlusion (AO) map, PNG format
-	Illumination maps (color + BW), PNG format
-	Normal map, PNG format
-	Gloss map, PNG format
-	Metalness map, PNG format

Depending on your game engine/3D application you may need to rescale the models.

The model is unskinned, unrigged and has no animations. Almost all 3D applications/game engines have their own built-in 
toolset for keyframe animations. Use this to create e.g. firing animations, etc.
