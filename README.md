This is a LARP version of the game [Empty Epsilon](http://emptyepsilon.org/). The aim here is to add screens and feature to the vanilla game to increase immersion and gm-oriented action.

Contributing
===========

Some general contribution rules (based of vanilla game):

1.  This project is a dictatorship. Yes, it's open source, but we'd much rather spend time on building what we like than arguing with people.

2.  Be precise when filing issues. Explain why you posted the issue, what you expect, what is happening, why is your feature worth the time to develop it, what operating system is affected, etc. Unclear issues are subject to rule 1 with extreme prejudice.

3.  Despite the above two, we very much value input, feedback, and suggestions from people playing EmptyEpsilon. If you have ideas or want to donate beer, drop us a line.
